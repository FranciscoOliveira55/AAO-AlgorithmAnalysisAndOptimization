# AAO-AlgorithmAnalysisAndOptimization

This program implements:
  - A **Greedy Algorithm**;
  - A **Genetic Algorithm**;
  - A **Simulated Annealing Algorithm**;

It uses these algorithms to solve several **UFLP** (**Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem**) instances with different complexities.

## Usage

Simply run the `Main.java` file.
